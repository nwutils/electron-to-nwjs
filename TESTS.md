## Result of tests
The tests below were all done using a computer running Debian Bullseye, building the Porting Kit application.

At first I tried to test on macOS High Sierra as well, but for some reason webpack doesn't seem to work properly in it; it skips some of the plugins when targetting old NW.js versions, and the final build ends up just not working.

Since Mac builds can be created in any system, I will just ignore that for now. Although, once we get to the point of making electron-builder working we gonna need Apple's code signing, which can only be made on macOS, we gonna need to find a fix for that.
